# ✈️ Jet Dodger

A fast-paced 2D airplane shooter game made with **Pygame**, where you dodge enemy rockets, fire missiles, and try to survive as long as possible.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

You control a small jet aircraft navigating through the skies filled with enemy rockets and clouds. The goal is to survive and score as many points as possible by:

- **Dodging** rockets (+1 point)
- **Destroying** rockets with missiles (+2 points)
- **Staying alive** — you have 3 lives!

Once you lose all lives, the game ends and your final stats are displayed.
